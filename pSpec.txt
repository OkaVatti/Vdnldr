YouTube Video Downloader written in C

TODO: Retrieve Video URL: You need to extract the direct video URL from the 
        YouTube page's HTML, typically available in the page source code.

        YouTube streams using blob links
            - i.e;
                blob:https://www.youtube.com/4826b806-caa5-4e0f-814c-0ec94467e717

TODO: Initiate an HTTP GET Request: Use libcurl to make an HTTP GET request 
        to the video URL. This request will retrieve the video data in chunks.

TODO: Receive Video Data: As you make the GET request, you'll receive video 
        data in chunks. You need to save and organize these chunks in your program.

TODO: Save Video Locally: As you receive video data chunks, you'll save them
        locally to form the complete video file. You need to handle situations 
        where the video is divided into multiple streams (e.g., video and audio) 
        and merge them correctly.

TODO: Video Format: YouTube videos are often available in various formats and 
        quality levels. You need to decide which format you want to download 
        and handle the corresponding data.

TODO: Video Metadata: While the primary focus here is on downloading the video 
        data, it's a good practice to obtain video metadata from the 
        YouTube Data API (separately) to provide information like the 
        video title, author, description, etc.

TODO: FFmpeg Integration (Optional): If you want to convert the video format or 
        perform any post-processing on the downloaded video, you can use FFmpeg. 
        This step comes after downloading the video data.
